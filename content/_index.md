## Hello, I am Ryan.

I strive for simple solutions to complex problems.

**📍 New York, NY | Software Engineer II @ AWS**

I am particularly passionate about the fintech space, where technology and finance intersect to solve complex, high-impact problems. My experience in building resilient, secure, and customer-centric systems directly overlaps with the demands of fintech—where scalability, reliability, and compliance are essential. I am excited by opportunities to apply my expertise in cloud-native architectures, system monitoring, and end-to-end development to innovations in payments, trading systems, and financial infrastructure.
