I'm a Software Engineer II at Amazon Web Services working on payment compliance and infrastructure for AWS Marketplace.

## What I Do

I build resilient, scalable systems that solve complex problems. My focus is on the intersection of cloud architecture, system design, and fintech—where reliability, compliance, and performance are non-negotiable.

## Background

I graduated from the University of Michigan with a B.S.E. in Computer Science (Magna Cum Laude) and have spent my career building production systems at AWS. I've worked on distributed systems processing millions of requests per day, led infrastructure redesigns that unlocked hundreds of millions in annual revenue, and mentored engineers on system design principles.

## Interests

- **Fintech & Payments** - Building the financial infrastructure of tomorrow
- **Distributed Systems** - Designing systems that scale and remain consistent
- **Cloud Architecture** - Leveraging AWS to solve business-critical problems
- **System Design** - Breaking down complex problems into elegant solutions
- **Trading & Quant Systems** - Algorithmic systems and quantitative analysis

## Outside of Work

I'm passionate about continuous learning. I've built multiple mobile apps (iOS/Android), explored quantitative trading systems, and contributed to open-source projects. I also run the M-HEAL Solar Fridge project at the University of Michigan, which develops thermoelectric systems to improve vaccine storage in developing countries.
