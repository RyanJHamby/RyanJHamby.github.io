						This project is a feature-rich music streaming application that allows users to create and listen to 
						personalized playlists based on their listening habits. The app integrates with various music APIs 
						to provide real-time streaming and recommendations.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of the core features is a recommendation engine that suggests songs using a combination of 
						collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. The backend is powered by AWS Lambda for 
						efficient and scalable processing, with Dagger used to manage dependencies within the Java codebase.

					<h2>Multivariable Covariance of Inverted Yield Curve Day Trader Bot</h2>
					<p>Sept 2023-Dec 2023</p>
					<img src="images/InvertedYieldTrader.png" alt="" width="100%" />
					<p>Often times when deciding when to buy into the market, I take into account economic factors like inflation,
						interest rates,
						GDP, and even the inverted yield curve. To test a theory about their relation to day-to-day trading, I wrote a
						program that would
						find the covariance of these factors each with inverted yield in order to calculate a confidence score for
						trading each day.
					</p>
					<p>
						With this confidence score, I was able to design a way to trade within reason on a per-minute cadence. In
						between days,
						I would write this data to DDB and S3 for future analysis. The end goal for this program is to incorporate
						Amazon SageMaker to improve
						the ML characteristics of the program.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some optimizations that I performed on this program included using a profiler to reduce the runtime of certain
						functions,
						using the STL, and writing values to DDB and S3 in batches.
					</p>

						Check out the website here! <a href="https://elegant-strudel-f64bcd.netlify.app/">EV Calculator</a>
					</p>
					<p>In order to gain more experience with Typescript and React, I created a website that would display an assortment of
						sustainable fuel vehicles. The primary focus of this project was to learn more about creating a React app from scratch,
						meaning that I wanted to set up ESLint, Jest, Babel, Webpack, API calls, hooks, pages, components, etc. 
					</p>
					<p>
						A couple challenging features that I implemented included debounced searching, sorting, filtering, and pagination.

					<h2>SmartCycle Machine Learning Recycling App</h2>
					<p>May 2020-Sept 2021</p>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/smartcycle.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
					<p>It becomes more apparent every year that climate change is rapidly changing the world. My mission
						is to
						help stop the harmful effects of climate change by using technology. Recently, I took
						some time to do
						a personal project to encourage recycling.
					</p>
					<p>
						The only incentive to recycling in most US states is a moral obligation to the environment. In
						other countries
						such as Germany, reverse vending machines for recycling are
						much more widespread.
						I wanted to make an application and sensor that would affordably adapt regular recycling bins to
						function as
						reverse recycling machines, while still rewarding recyclers. To start, users would be able to
						use the points at local
						restaurants and stores. In the future, it would be revolutionary to convert the point system
						directly into a monetary system
						to sync with bank accounts, much like how reverse vending machines reward recyclers with money.
					</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/reverse.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
					<p>
						Currently, my app only runs on iOS, but I hope to be able to develop
						the technology and publish it to the app store some day.
					</p>
					<p> I was able to take advantage of the IBM Cloud Machine Learning algorithm to train data on
						thousands of images of
						bottles, cans, glasses, and other common recyclable items that I pulled from the internet
						. I also crafted the algorithm to discriminate against
						many common reusable water bottles to prevent people from cheating the system. The packaged data
						was then trained using the Apple CoreML program, which could be easily
						integrated into my Swift files that I made for the different screens of the app. Data for each
						user such as name, email,
						points accumulated, and rewards were backed up using Google Firebase.

					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/amazon.png" alt="" height="80px" /></span></p>
					<p>As a full-time SDE II, I design, develop, and monitor software in a large-scale production environment. What I enjoy
						most about full-stack development is I can engineer API's from a customer use-case
						perspective, and deliver domain-specific solutions while handling ambiguity. On my team at AWS, I have been able to
						practice continuously deploying code that integrates with
						multiple AWS microservices. During oncall rotations and in between big projects, I perform maintenance on current
						solutions to improve operations.
					</p>
					<p>During the time at Amazon as an intern, I created a tool that improved event impact lookup times for oncall members
						by 300%. The biggest takeaway I got from the internship
						was being able to improve my software engineering workflow to be able to plan thoroughly and
						ship code quickly.

						<p>During my internship
							with T-Mobile, I took advantage of the opportunity to learn about how one of America's top
							cell networks is constructed
							and developed.
						</p>
						<p> I was able to develop a Python program that parsed T-Mobile private site online data using a
							webscraping driver with Selenium.
							The program formatted the performance metrics into Excel reports that could be sent to
							engineers in a much shorter
							time period than having engineers do it manually each day.

						<h2>M-HEAL</h2>
						<p>Internal Vice President | March 2021-April 2022</p>
						<p>
							Michigan Health Engineered for All Lives is a student-run organization of 200 students at
							the University of Michigan focused on
							improved healthcare and medical technologies all around the world. The club features 12
							independent project teams
							that cover a range of global health problems, including developing hypothermia therapy for
							neonates with asphyxia as well as
							improving nutrition for children with cerebral palsy in Bangladesh.
						</p>
						<p>
							My job as IVP was to manage and oversee the progress of all 12 remarkable projects and
							provide resources and opportunities for
							each of the teams to grow. I helped organize design reviews for the whole club to attend,
							facilitate recruiting, meet with external partners,
							and work closely with our President and External Vice President to direct the rest of our
							14-person board.

							<h2>M-HEAL Solar Fridge</h2>
							<p>Project Team Lead & Electrical Sub Team Lead | Jan 2019-Present</p>
						</header>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/mheal.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
						<p>Solar Fridge is a student-run project team that is a part of Michigan Health
							Engineered for All Lives. Our 15 member team is iterating through insulation and
							thermoelectric
							refridgeration designs in order to cool vaccine coolers. We work with a community
							partner in Rincon Claro, Dominican Republic to elicit requirements.
						</p>
						<p>
							Many developing countries lack the resources to consistently provide electricity to
							residents, and natural disasters
							further deplete electricity availability.
							We have improved the amount of time that dorm fridges can sustain a 2-8<sup>o</sup>C range
							by over 800%, and our goal is to extend this
							range so that the clinic can maintain vaccine viability for at least 72 hours when the power
							shuts off.
						</p>
						<p>
							As the project team lead, I scheduled and lead meetings, gave presentations to our club,
							applied for grants and
							managed finances, attended workshops, communicated with our community partner, and lead
							recruitment. I also oversaw a
							lot of our project design and am particularly focused on creating a touchscreen LCD digital
							data logger that displays
							current and previous vaccine temperatures. Also, I created a PCB to condense the
							thermocouple leads and implemented
							the Arduino code driver that controls the display and SD card interface.

							<p>Fall 2020 Cohort Member</p>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/mayMo.jpg" alt="" height="180px" /></span></p>
							<p>
								During the fall semester of my junior year, I worked on a team of four students as part
								of a
								company-in-residence program. Our team worked exclusively with May Mobility, an
								autonomous shuttle startup
								that has deployed shuttles in several Michigan communities such as Ann Arbor, Detroit,
								and Grand Rapids, as
								well as in Providence, RI.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our team developed a hardware tool that improved testing procedures for the company,
								which allowed for more
								consistent test results and an ability to demonstrate safety. I personally worked on the
								wiring component of
								the tool to make sure that it works in non-ideal conditions and can be easily set up by
								test engineers.
							</p>
							<p>
								It would be helpful to show some pictures of the product and detail more about how it
								works,
								but this information is restricted by the non-disclosure agreement.

						<h2>Phone-Free Driving Device</h2>
						<p>Owner | Sep 2019 - Dec 2019</p>
						<p>
							As part of the UM 3D Printing Club, a handful of teams entered into the GM Additive
							Manufacting
							Design Competition. The goal of the competition was to be able to design an improvement to a
							car
							with the aid of a 3D printer.
						</p>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/car.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
						<p>In order to prevent drivers from texting and driving, I designed a phone holder that
							restricted
							phone access unless the car was at a complete stop.
						</p>
						<p>
							I designed the parts in AutoCAD in the shape of a box with a slot to fit a phone into.
							Once I 3D printed the part, I was able to attach a Servo motor to the inside as part of a
							mechanism to
							open and close the lid. I controlled this using an Arduino that attached to the back and
							also interfaced
							with a GPS module (that determined whether the car was in motion) and an ultrasonic sensor
							(for hands-free opening of the lid).
						</p>
						<p>
							I was honored to place 2nd in the competition, and I developed substantial design
							experience with Arduino and
							3D printing from the project.
