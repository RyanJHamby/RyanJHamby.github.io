				<img src="images/InvertedYieldTrader.png" alt="Yield Curve Bot" width="100%" />

				<p>
					Often when deciding when to buy into the market, I take into account economic factors like inflation, interest rates,
					GDP, and even the inverted yield curve. To test a theory about their relation to day-to-day trading, I wrote a program that would
					find the covariance of these factors each with inverted yield in order to calculate a confidence score for trading each day.
				</p>
				<p>
					With this confidence score, I was able to design a way to trade within reason on a per-minute cadence. 
					Between days, I wrote this data to DDB and S3 for future analysis. 
					The end goal is to incorporate Amazon SageMaker to improve the ML characteristics of the program.

    <h2>M-HEAL</h2>
    <p>Internal Vice President | March 2021-April 2022</p>
    <p>
        Michigan Health Engineered for All Lives is a student-run organization of 200 students at
        the University of Michigan focused on
        improved healthcare and medical technologies all around the world. The club features 12
        independent project teams
        that cover a range of global health problems, including developing hypothermia therapy for
        neonates with asphyxia as well as
        improving nutrition for children with cerebral palsy in Bangladesh.
    </p>
    <p>
        My job as IVP was to manage and oversee the progress of all 12 remarkable projects and
        provide resources and opportunities for
        each of the teams to grow. I helped organize design reviews for the whole club to attend,
        facilitate recruiting, meet with external partners,
        and work closely with our President and External Vice President to direct the rest of our
        14-person board.

        <h2>M-HEAL Solar Fridge</h2>
        <p>Project Team Lead & Electrical Sub Team Lead | Jan 2019-Present</p>

    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/mheal.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
    <p>Solar Fridge is a student-run project team that is a part of Michigan Health
        Engineered for All Lives. Our 15 member team is iterating through insulation and
        thermoelectric
        refridgeration designs in order to cool vaccine coolers. We work with a community
        partner in Rincon Claro, Dominican Republic to elicit requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many developing countries lack the resources to consistently provide electricity to
        residents, and natural disasters
        further deplete electricity availability.
        We have improved the amount of time that dorm fridges can sustain a 2-8<sup>o</sup>C range
        by over 800%, and our goal is to extend this
        range so that the clinic can maintain vaccine viability for at least 72 hours when the power
        shuts off.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the project team lead, I scheduled and lead meetings, gave presentations to our club,
        applied for grants and
        managed finances, attended workshops, communicated with our community partner, and lead
        recruitment. I also oversaw a
        lot of our project design and am particularly focused on creating a touchscreen LCD digital
        data logger that displays
        current and previous vaccine temperatures. Also, I created a PCB to condense the
        thermocouple leads and implemented
        the Arduino code driver that controls the display and SD card interface.

        <p>Fall 2020 Cohort Member</p>
        <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/mayMo.jpg" alt="" height="180px" /></span></p>
        <p>
            During the fall semester of my junior year, I worked on a team of four students as part
            of a
            company-in-residence program. Our team worked exclusively with May Mobility, an
            autonomous shuttle startup
            that has deployed shuttles in several Michigan communities such as Ann Arbor, Detroit,
            and Grand Rapids, as
            well as in Providence, RI.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our team developed a hardware tool that improved testing procedures for the company,
            which allowed for more
            consistent test results and an ability to demonstrate safety. I personally worked on the
            wiring component of
            the tool to make sure that it works in non-ideal conditions and can be easily set up by
            test engineers.
        </p>
        <p>
            It would be helpful to show some pictures of the product and detail more about how it
            works,
            but this information is restricted by the non-disclosure agreement.

    <h2>Phone-Free Driving Device</h2>
    <p>Owner | Sep 2019 - Dec 2019</p>
    <p>
        As part of the UM 3D Printing Club, a handful of teams entered into the GM Additive
        Manufacting
        Design Competition. The goal of the competition was to be able to design an improvement to a
        car
        with the aid of a 3D printer.
    </p>
    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/car.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
    <p>In order to prevent drivers from texting and driving, I designed a phone holder that
        restricted
        phone access unless the car was at a complete stop.
    </p>
    <p>
        I designed the parts in AutoCAD in the shape of a box with a slot to fit a phone into.
        Once I 3D printed the part, I was able to attach a Servo motor to the inside as part of a
        mechanism to
        open and close the lid. I controlled this using an Arduino that attached to the back and
        also interfaced
        with a GPS module (that determined whether the car was in motion) and an ultrasonic sensor
        (for hands-free opening of the lid).
    </p>
    <p>
        I was honored to place 2nd in the competition, and I developed substantial design
        experience with Arduino and
        3D printing from the project.

    <h2>SmartCycle Machine Learning Recycling App</h2>
    <p>May 2020-Sept 2021</p>
    <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/smartcycle.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
    <p>It becomes more apparent every year that climate change is rapidly changing the world. My mission
        is to
        help stop the harmful effects of climate change by using technology. Recently, I took
        some time to do
        a personal project to encourage recycling.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only incentive to recycling in most US states is a moral obligation to the environment. In
        other countries
        such as Germany, reverse vending machines for recycling are
        much more widespread.
        I wanted to make an application and sensor that would affordably adapt regular recycling bins to
        function as
        reverse recycling machines, while still rewarding recyclers. To start, users would be able to
        use the points at local
        restaurants and stores. In the future, it would be revolutionary to convert the point system
        directly into a monetary system
        to sync with bank accounts, much like how reverse vending machines reward recyclers with money.
    </p>
    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/reverse.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
    <p>
        Currently, my app only runs on iOS, but I hope to be able to develop
        the technology and publish it to the app store some day.
    </p>
    <p> I was able to take advantage of the IBM Cloud Machine Learning algorithm to train data on
        thousands of images of
        bottles, cans, glasses, and other common recyclable items that I pulled from the internet
        . I also crafted the algorithm to discriminate against
        many common reusable water bottles to prevent people from cheating the system. The packaged data
        was then trained using the Apple CoreML program, which could be easily
        integrated into my Swift files that I made for the different screens of the app. Data for each
        user such as name, email,
        points accumulated, and rewards were backed up using Google Firebase.
