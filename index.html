				<strong>📍 New York, NY | Software Engineer II @ AWS</strong><br/><br/>
				I am particularly passionate about the fintech space, where technology and finance intersect to solve complex, high-impact problems. My experience in building resilient, secure, and customer-centric systems directly overlaps with the demands of fintech—where scalability, reliability, and compliance are essential. I am excited by opportunities to apply my expertise in cloud-native architectures, system monitoring, and end-to-end development to innovations in payments, trading systems, and financial infrastructure.

						improving nutrition for children with cerebral palsy in Bangladesh.
					</p>
					<p>
						My job as IVP was to manage and oversee the progress of all 12 remarkable projects and
						provide resources and opportunities for
						each of the teams to grow. I helped organize design reviews for the whole club to attend,
						facilitate recruiting, meet with external partners,

					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/mheal.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
					<p>Solar Fridge is a student-run project team that is a part of Michigan Health
						Engineered for All Lives. Our 15 member team is iterating through insulation and
						thermoelectric
						refridgeration designs in order to cool vaccine coolers. We work with a community
						partner in Rincon Claro, Dominican Republic to elicit requirements.
					</p>
					<p>
						Many developing countries lack the resources to consistently provide electricity to
						residents, and natural disasters
						further deplete electricity availability.
						We have improved the amount of time that dorm fridges can sustain a 2-8<sup>o</sup>C range
						by over 800%, and our goal is to extend this
						range so that the clinic can maintain vaccine viability for at least 72 hours when the power
						shuts off.
					</p>
					<p>
						As the project team lead, I scheduled and lead meetings, gave presentations to our club,
						applied for grants and
						managed finances, attended workshops, communicated with our community partner, and lead
						recruitment. I also oversaw a
						lot of our project design and am particularly focused on creating a touchscreen LCD digital
						data logger that displays
						current and previous vaccine temperatures. Also, I created a PCB to condense the
						thermocouple leads and implemented
						the Arduino code driver that controls the display and SD card interface.

					<p>
						During the fall semester of my junior year, I worked on a team of four students as part
						of a
						company-in-residence program. Our team worked exclusively with May Mobility, an
						autonomous shuttle startup
						that has deployed shuttles in several Michigan communities such as Ann Arbor, Detroit,
						and Grand Rapids, as
						well as in Providence, RI.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our team developed a hardware tool that improved testing procedures for the company,
						which allowed for more
						consistent test results and an ability to demonstrate safety. I personally worked on the
						wiring component of
						the tool to make sure that it works in non-ideal conditions and can be easily set up by
						test engineers.
					</p>
					<p>
						It would be helpful to show some pictures of the product and detail more about how it
						works,
						but this information is restricted by the non-disclosure agreement.

					<p>
						As part of the UM 3D Printing Club, a handful of teams entered into the GM Additive
						Manufacting
						Design Competition. The goal of the competition was to be able to design an improvement to a
						car
						with the aid of a 3D printer.
					</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/car.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
					<p>In order to prevent drivers from texting and driving, I designed a phone holder that
						restricted
						phone access unless the car was at a complete stop.
					</p>
					<p>
						I designed the parts in AutoCAD in the shape of a box with a slot to fit a phone into.
						Once I 3D printed the part, I was able to attach a Servo motor to the inside as part of a
						mechanism to
						open and close the lid. I controlled this using an Arduino that attached to the back and
						also interfaced
						with a GPS module (that determined whether the car was in motion) and an ultrasonic sensor
						(for hands-free opening of the lid).
					</p>
					<p>
						I was honored to place 2nd in the competition, and I developed substantial design
						experience with Arduino and
						3D printing from the project.

						<h3>SmartCycle Machine Learning Recycling App</h3>
						<p><em>May 2020 - Sept 2021</em></p>
					</header>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/smartcycle.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
					<p>It becomes more apparent every year that climate change is rapidly changing the world. My mission
						is to
						help stop the harmful effects of climate change by using technology. Recently, I took
						some time to do
						a personal project to encourage recycling.
					</p>
					<p>
						The only incentive to recycling in most US states is a moral obligation to the environment. In
						other countries
						such as Germany, reverse vending machines for recycling are
						much more widespread.
						I wanted to make an application and sensor that would affordably adapt regular recycling bins to
						function as
						reverse recycling machines, while still rewarding recyclers. To start, users would be able to
						use the points at local
						restaurants and stores. In the future, it would be revolutionary to convert the point system
						directly into a monetary system
						to sync with bank accounts, much like how reverse vending machines reward recyclers with money.
					</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/reverse.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
					<p>
						Currently, my app only runs on iOS, but I hope to be able to develop
						the technology and publish it to the app store some day.
					</p>
					<p> I was able to take advantage of the IBM Cloud Machine Learning algorithm to train data on
						thousands of images of
						bottles, cans, glasses, and other common recyclable items that I pulled from the internet
						. I also crafted the algorithm to discriminate against
						many common reusable water bottles to prevent people from cheating the system. The packaged data
						was then trained using the Apple CoreML program, which could be easily
						integrated into my Swift files that I made for the different screens of the app. Data for each
						user such as name, email,
						points accumulated, and rewards were backed up using Google Firebase.
