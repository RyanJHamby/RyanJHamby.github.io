								<h2>SmartCycle Machine Learning Recycling App</h2>
								<p>Owner & Developer | May 2020-Present</p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/smartcycle.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
								<p>It becomes more apparent every year that climate change is rapidly changing the world. My mission is to
									help stop the harmful effects of climate change by using technology. This past spring, I took some time to do
									a personal project to encourage recycling.
								</p>
								<p>
									The only incentive to recycling in most US states is a moral obligation to the environment. In other countries
									such as Germany--which I visited in summer 2019-- reverse vending machines for recycling are much more widespread.
									I wanted to make an application and sensor that would affordably adapt regular recycling bins to function as 
									reverse recycling machines, while still rewarding recyclers. To start, users would be able to use the points at local 
									restaurants and stores. In the future, it would be revolutionary to convert the point system directly into a monetary system
									to sync with bank accounts, much like how reverse vending machines reward recyclers with money.
								</p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/reverse.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
								<p>
									Currently, my app only runs on iOS and is still in development, but I hope to be able to develop the technology
									and publish it to the app store by the end of 2021. I also am working on my provisional patent for the material in hopes
									that it will further develop in the future. If the techonology scales well, I plan to market this to universities,
									corporations, and municipalities to encourage staff and the public to recycle more frequently. 
								</p>
								<p> I was able to take advantage of the IBM Cloud Machine Learning algorithm to train data on thousands of images of 
									bottles, cans, glasses, and other common recyclable items that I pulled from the internet
									. I also crafted the algorithm to discriminate against 
									many common reusable water bottles to prevent people from cheating the system. The packaged data was then trained using the Apple CoreML program, which could be easily
									integrated into my Swift files that I made for the different screens of the app. Data for each user such as name, email, 
									points accumulated, and rewards were backed up using Google Firebase.

								<h2>M-HEAL</h2>
								<p>Internal Vice President | March 2021-April 2022 (Incomplete-- Medical)</p>
								<p>
								Michigan Health Engineered for All Lives is a student-run organization of 300 students at the University of Michigan focused on
								improved healthcare and medical technologies all around the world. The club features 10 independent project teams
								that cover a range of global health problems, including developing hypothermia therapy for neonates with asphyxia as well as 
								improving nutrition for children with cerebral palsy in Bangladesh.
								</p>
								<p>
								My job as IVP is to manage and oversee the progress of all 10 remarkable projects and provide resources and opportunities for 
								each of the teams to grow. I organize design reviews for the whole club to attend, facilitate recruiting, meet with external partners,
								and work closely with our President and External Vice President to direct the rest of our 14-person board.

								<h2>M-HEAL Solar Fridge</h2>
								<p>Project Team Lead | Jan 2020-Present</p>
							</header>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/mheal.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
							<p>Solar Fridge is a completely student-run project team that is a part of Michigan Health Engineered for All Lives. Our 10 member team is developing
								affordable insulation to convert dormitory-style vaccine fridges into WHO-approved vaccine refrigerators. We work with a community
								partner in Rincon Claro, Dominican Republic, and we hope to visit soon when travel is once again allowed. 
								</p>
								<p>
								Many developing countries lack the resources to consistently provide electricity to residents, and natural disasters 
								further deplete electricity availability. 
								We have improved the amount of time that dorm fridges can sustain a 2-8<sup>o</sup>C range by over 800%, and our goal is to extend this 
								range so that the clinic can maintain vaccine viability for at least 72 hours when the power shuts off. 
								</p>
								<p>
								As the project team lead, I schedule and lead meetings, give presentations to our club, apply for grants and 
								manage finances, attend workshops, communicate with our community partner, and lead recruitment. I also oversee a 
								lot of our project design and am particularly focused on creating a touchscreen LCD digital data logger that displays
								current and previous vaccine temperatures. Also, I created a PCB to condense the thermocouple leads and implemented 
								the Arduino code driver that controls the display and SD card interface.

                                <p>During my eight day stint with TI before being rushed to the hospital for cancer treatment, I learned about semiconductor manufacturing at a very in-depth level. I worked on a Python program that was aimed to automate new product testing, and also learned plenty about new product qualification reports and statistical analysis. Although I did not get much time to finish much work at TI, I really enjoyed the company culture and opportunities online to learn more about TI's products and technical development opportunities.
                                </p>

								<h2>T-Mobile</h2>
								<p>RF Engineer Intern III | June 2020-Aug 2020</p>
							</header>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/tmobile.png" alt="" /></span></p>
							<p>Telecommunications are more important than ever as the workforce migrates to mobile platforms. During my internship
								with T-Mobile, I took advantage of the opportunity to learn about how one of America's top cell networks is constructed
								and developed. 
							</p>
							<p> I was able to develop a Python program that parsed T-Mobile private site online data using a webscraping driver.
								The program formatted the performance metrics into Excel reports that could be sent to engineers in a much quicker 
								time period than having engineers do it manually each day. 
							</p>
								It was very enjoyable to work every day with my team, even though it was entirely virtual. I learned a lot about how 
								corporations manage and structure work, and the importance of a work-life balance.

								<h2>TechLab at Mcity</h2>
								<p>Fall 2020 Cohort Member</p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/mayMo.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
								<p>
								During the fall semester of my junior year, I worked on a team of four students as part of a 
								company-in-residence program. Our team worked exclusively with May Mobility, an autonomous shuttle startup 
								that has deployed shuttles in several Michigan communities such as Ann Arbor, Detroit, and Grand Rapids, as 
								well as in Providence, RI. 
								</p>
								<p>
								Our team developed a hardware tool that improved testing procedures for the company, which allowed for more 
								consistent test results and an ability to demonstrate safety. I personally worked on the wiring component of 
								the tool to make sure that it works in non-ideal conditions and can be easily set up by test engineers.
								</p>
								<p>
									It would be helpful to show some pictures of the product and detail more about how it works, 
									but this information is restricted by the non-disclosure agreement.

									<h2>Phone-Free Driving Device</h2>
									<p>Owner | Sep 2019 - Dec 2019</p>
								<p>
								As part of the UM 3D Printing Club, a handful of teams entered into the GM Additive Manufacting
								Design Competition. The goal of the competition was to be able to design an improvement to a car 
								with the aid of a 3D printer. 
								</p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/car.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
								<p>I was randomly placed on a team with two other students, but they soon had to drop the team due 
									to heavy courseloads. Although I was going up against larger teams and I easily could have dropped
									as well, I decided to stick with it. Ultimately, I designed a phone holder that restricted drivers from 
									texting and driving unless the car is at a complete stop. 
								</p>
								<p>
									I designed the part in AutoCAD in the shape of a box with a slot to fit a phone into.
									Once I 3D printed the part, I was able to attach a Servo motor to the inside as part of a mechanism to 
									open and close the lid. I controlled this using an Arduino that attached to the back and also interfaced
									with a GPS module (that determined whether the car was in motion) and an ultrasonic sensor (for hands-free opening of the lid).
								</p>
								<p>
									I was pleased to place 2nd in the competition, and I got a lot of fundamental design experience with Arduino and 
									3D printing from the project.

								<h2>UM College of Engineering</h2>
								<p>Peer Mentor | May 2019 - Dec 2019</p>
								<p>
								I was able to assist five first year students with the transition to college through a summer/semester 
								of peer mentoring. I hosted office hours weekly and reached out to my mentees to make sure that they 
								were managing the semester well. My most useful contribution was making a list of tips for students before arriving 
								on campus, which can be found here:

							<h2>Berlin Study Abroad</h2>
							<p>May 2019 - June 2019</p>
							<p>After my freshman year, I was fortunate enough to study abroad in Berlin, Germany for six weeks.
								During my time there, I took an introductory course in German and did a research project for a
								company called PYOT Labs GmbH. The project involved finding optimal 3D printing conditions for 
								a PP/CaSiO<sub>3</sub> polymer that we manufactured and tested in a lab.
							</p>
							<p>
								On the weekends, we were able to take many side trips to different countries. I was able to explore
								Rome, Vienna, Dresden, Prague, and Munich. I am very excited to revisit Europe at some point in the future,
								and I included some of my favorite pictures from the trip below.
