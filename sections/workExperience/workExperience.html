					As a Software Development Engineer II, I design, build, and maintain scalable software systems in a high-availability production environment. 
					I specialize in full-stack development, creating solutions tailored to customer needs, and work within an AWS microservices architecture using continuous deployment practices. 
					During on-call rotations, which I have accumulated for a total of 91 days, I ensure system reliability by proactively troubleshooting and resolving production issues.
